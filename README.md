## Full-Stack Developer

I'm a developer trying to kickstart it's career. I'm always looking for new and exciting challenges.
## Myself
I'm quite passionate about coding. Problem solving is the task that I personally enjoy the most.
I don't care what technology we use, we'll get the best out of it.

I'm currently learning firebase and flowbite to develop overall better full-stack apps.

## Tech Stack
During the soyHenry bootcamp I learned the 'PERN' stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node).
Rather sooner than later I learned about this amazing platform called Firebase, which offers backend-as-a-service (BAAS).
Another discovery I just can't stop using is tailwindCSS and flowbite-react. This two libraries make UI design a breeze.
And well, some other not so amazing libraries, such as Redux and Bootstrap. Don't get me wrong, they are ~not really~ great.

### Aspiration
I'm looking to get a job on IT as a front, back or full-stack developer.
